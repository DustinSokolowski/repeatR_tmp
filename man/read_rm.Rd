\usage{
read_rm(file, tibble = FALSE, keep_order = TRUE, include_secondary = FALSE)
}
\value{
A data.frame in which each row represents a (portion of) and alignment
between a query sequence (usually a genome) and a reference repeat.
Columns are
\itemize{
   \item score score The Smith-Waterman score for this alignment-section
   \item p_sub proportion of mismatches (substitutions)
   \item p_del propotion of deletions relative to target
   \item p_ins proportions of insertins relative to target
   \item qname query (usually chromosome or scaffold) name
   \item qstart start position in query sequence
   \item qend end position in query sequence
   \item qextend query sequence remaining after alignment
   \item complement is the alignment reverse and complement ("C") or same strnd ("+")
   \item tname target (repeat) name
   \item tclass target (repeat) class
   \item tstart start position in target sequence
   \item tend end position in target sequence
   \item textend target sequence remaining after alignment
   \item ID alignment ID (can be shared by multiple rows if targets interrupt each other)
   \item ali_type alignment type (primary for best alignment for this query region, secondary for others)
}
