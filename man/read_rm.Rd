\usage{
read_rm(file, tibble = TRUE, include_secondary = FALSE, quiet = FALSE)
}
\value{
A data.frame in which each row represents a (portion of) and alignment
between a query sequence (usually a genome) and a reference repeat.
Columns are
\itemize{
   \item \textbf{score} score The Smith-Waterman score for this alignment-section
   \item \textbf{p_sub} proportion of mismatches (substitutions)
   \item \textbf{p_del} propotion of deletions relative to target
   \item \textbf{p_ins} proportions of insertins relative to target
   \item \textbf{qname} query (usually chromosome or scaffold) name
   \item \textbf{qstart} start position in query sequence
   \item \textbf{qend} end position in query sequence
   \item \textbf{qextend} query sequence remaining after alignment
   \item \textbf{complement} is the alignment reverse and complement ("C") or same strnd ("+")
   \item \textbf{tname} target (repeat) name
   \item \textbf{tclass} target (repeat) class
   \item \textbf{tstart} start position in target sequence
   \item \textbf{tend} end position in target sequence
   \item \textbf{textend} target sequence remaining after alignment
   \item \textbf{ID} alignment ID (can be shared by multiple rows if targets interrupt each other)
   \item \textbf{ali_type} alignment type (primary for best alignment for this query region, secondary for others)
}
